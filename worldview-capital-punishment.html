              <p><span class="firstcharacter">"W</span>e love because he first loved us” (1 John 4:19). This verse serves as the foundation of my worldview and characterizes the way that I see the world and others. My faith has a significant impact on all aspects of my worldview and allows me to differentiate what I see as truth. </p>

              <p>My epistemology or my belief in “what knowledge is, how we acquire it, and how we can identify it” (Wyma 4), largely follows the rationalist justification. Rationalism is defined as the “justification of knowledge through reason” (Wyma 7). Concepts and ideas that are supported by factual evidence as well as historical belief and thought formulate knowledge that I identify as truth. Examples of rationalism at work can be seen through my trust in mathematics. The power and value given to numbers is a self-evident truth, or rational insight, that I have always taken as fact, as do most others. Additionally, I use these self-evident truths to help support new ideas and theories, and through deductive reasoning, I can discern what is true or false. But rationalism does not necessarily offer to reason for my belief in God, so this is where my inspirationist epistemological view stems from. While the Bible helps me understand who God is to me, my faith comes from my experience and relationship with God. Throughout my life, I have felt a supernatural peace and presence from my belief in Him, that in words can be difficult to explain. My relationship with God and being able to communicate with Him, especially through prayer, music, and nature has brought me to personal revelations and conviction, seeing all people as loved and created children of God, worthy of grace and care. </p>
              <p>Next, comes my metaphysical view which centers on the dualist perspective, that humanity is more than just the physical body, but it includes “the non-material mind”, including the soul and spirit. Much of Scripture talks about the importance of the body, soul, and spirit, an example of which states, “If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body” (1 Corinthians 15:44). Therefore, my faith and belief in God help me trust and justify that humans are of both body and spirit and that there is an inherent value for life that goes beyond just the physical.</p>
              <p>As for my political ideology, I align with the economic left and libertarian quadrant. Much of the reason that I am located in this area of the political compass is due to my value for equality. “So, God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him, male and female he created them” (Genesis 1:27). Since all humans are created in the image of God, all are deserving of equal rights, despite social or economic standing. Additionally, we are called to love and care for people, which is why we should allow for all to have autonomy over themselves, but also financial give and disperse to those in need. To love one another is to serve one another, which is reflected in my left-libertarian political ideology.</p>
              <p>Lastly, my ethical view aligns best with Kantianism, which “considers action the most important subject of morality” (Wyma 34). The basis of this ethical view is that all people should be treated with respect because every individual is valuable. Reflecting on my faith and the Scripture from Genesis 1:27, since all people are created equally in the image of God, all are worthy of being treated fairly and equitably, and the Kantian position best fits this view. An important distinction in Kantianism is that every individual has autonomy. Though I believe in the Christian religion, I believe that God gives humans free will to do what they please. We are not forced to believe in God or certain ideologies, but we can make those distinctions for ourselves. “For you were called to freedom […] through love serve one another” (Galatians 5:13). It is through our free will and autonomy that we can care for others and value their individual lives and wellbeing.</p>
              <p>“Yes, Pa. should have a death penalty”, an editorial by Paul Muschick, argues that the death penalty should be maintained. The governor of Pennsylvania, Josh Shapiro, advised lawmakers to terminate capital punishment, and Muschick very strongly disagrees with this plea. His central claim states, “[…] a person who commits a heinous crime deserves to pay the ultimate penalty” (Muschick). The author also explains that without the death penalty, taxpayers will pay to keep these criminals and killers alive, rather than sentencing them to the “death they deserve”. Since the justice system, in Muschick’s perspective, is meant to punish those who break the law, the death penalty should be a viable option for murderers.</p>
              <p>Based on Muschick’s idea that capital punishment will bring justice to wrong-doings and sentencing criminals to death which helps ensure the safety and well-being of others, he would likely agree with utilitarian ethics. This ethical view explains that “whether something is good or evil, wrong, is whether it would make the world a better place” (Wyma 29). Now, it cannot be disputed that murder is evil, and murderers should suffer the consequences of their actions. Therefore, this ethical view rationalizes the acceptance of the death penalty because for justice to be served, criminals should be punished equally for their actions: essentially a life for a life. However, my ethical view cannot justify punishment by death. Since all people are valuable and priceless, no one deserves to be put to death by another human. Additionally, people are capable of change and growth, and therefore one who commits a terrible act can still learn from their mistakes and hopefully find redemption in a better life. Lastly, with the universal law of Kantian ethics, if murder is wrong, then it should be wrong under every circumstance, not just for those who disobey the law. If murder can be justified to “those who deserve it” as opposed to “those who do not” there becomes a gray area for who can kill and when it is allowed. Murder being evil as a universal claim should therefore limit all from the act.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, the author’s political ideology would likely fall on the authoritarian scale, in favor of government policies for social issues. Muschick wants government involvement and policy regarding the justice system and specifically the death penalty. With this, he would fall into a more constrained view of humanity, believing that people are incapable of change and likely that murderers will always be murderers. This involvement of the government is just because it punishes those who disobey the government and holds them to equivalent standards for the crimes they have committed. As mentioned before, my political ideology is more libertarian, and thus I do not think that the government should have as much involvement in social issues. Now, I do agree that those who commit crimes should be punished for their actions. But my morality cannot justify giving the government the power to end lives. Systemically, the government and the justice system have shown their prejudice and racism toward people of color. Those of the black and brown community are disproportionately affected by the system, and thus it is difficult to eliminate bias, especially when it comes to the death penalty. Additionally, the death penalty has wrongly accused and killed “criminals” who were undeserving of their punishment. Muschick even addresses this in his article, yet he says that we must simply move past this. “In the past, it certainly has been fallible […] But Shapiro, and other governors who hold this power, should not be looking back. They should be looking forward” (Muschick). I strongly disagree with this claim because if the government is involved with the social issues of its country, it also must fix its broken system and fight for the rights of those who need it. It is not the government’s job to play God and determine when an individual's life is no longer valuable, and thus, my political view does not justify the death penalty.</p>
              <p>Now, my worldview is not perfect, and is subject to growth and change; it has both its strengths and weaknesses. My Kantian ethics prove to be a strength because it seeks to bring justice through fairness for all people. It allows for people's actions to be autonomous but also accounts for personal growth and change, something that I believe to be true for all people. It, therefore, holds all people as equal, encouraging equitable well-being. Though, there are potential weaknesses, including the debate of if individuals are truly autonomous. If we are held by moral principles, government laws, and other social standards, there becomes a disagreement about if we truly have free will or if our actions and choices are limited. My political ideology being left libertarian has its strengths in advocating for equal rights and treatment of all people, and hopefully eliminates any bias or prejudice that could come from the government or higher authorities. But, while it calls for minimal government involvement in social issues, its view of how much power the government should have been inconsistent as to maintain social freedom, it encourages economic government involvement, and therefore can be seen as contradictory and disreputable. </p>
              <p>Consequently, the subjectivity of worldview allows for the sustenance of beliefs and allows for new ideas to thrive. And while we may not always agree with the other perspectives, there is beauty in growing in understanding and living in a community with all people.</p>
